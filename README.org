*Work in progress !!*

These slides will be used for the HPC and Uncertainty Treatment course that will be held at la 'Maison de la Simulation'. Paris, France - 17-19 may 2015

This is my first experience with reveal.js and github pages, which is why I uploaded an unfinished version of the slides, to do some tests. /The final version of the slides will be ready for the 17th of may./
